This project implements a comprehensive data analytics solution for cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), providing interactive forecasting, risk assessment, and market sentiment analysis via a Streamlit web application.

The core goal of this project was to integrate time series modeling (Prophet) with advanced features (Volatility and NLP-based Sentiment Analysis) to provide data-driven insights for investment decision-making.
🚀 Features

Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Automated fetching and cleaning of historical BTC-USD price data using yfinance.

Time Series Forecasting (Prophet): Uses Meta's Prophet model to generate robust, long-term (up to 2 years) price predictions, including uncertainty intervals.

Volatility Analysis: Calculates and visualizes the 30-Day Rolling Volatility (Standard Deviation of Daily Returns) to quantify market risk.

Sentiment Analysis (NLP): Uses the VADER model from the NLTK library to analyze mock news headlines, providing a quick, quantifiable pulse of current market sentiment.

Interactive GUI: Built with Streamlit and Plotly for a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing user experience.

⚙️ Project Setup and Run Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the dashboard locally.

Prerequisites

You must have Python (3.8+) installed.

1. Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and install all required libraries:

pip install requests nltk pandas streamlit prophet plotly yfinance


2. Download NLTK Data

The Sentiment Analysis component requires the VADER lexicon data. Run this command once:

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"


3. Data Generation (Required First Step)

First, run the data collection script (crypto_data_collector.py) to download the historical price data. This creates the required bitcoin_historical_prices.csv file.

(Since we combined the data collection and EDA into a single file for simplicity, you will need to run the data collection code from the first step you completed.)

4. Launch the Dashboard

The application must be launched using the streamlit run command.

If the streamlit run command fails (due to the streamlit command not being recognized on Windows), use the full path to your Python executable, like this example:

& C:/Users/YourName/.../python3.11.exe -m streamlit run "crypto_dashboard.py"


Once launched, your web browser will automatically open the application at http://localhost:8501.

📚 Project Files

crypto_dashboard.py: The single, complete Python file containing all Streamlit logic, Prophet modeling, volatility calculation, and sentiment analysis.

bitcoin_historical_prices.csv: The input data file generated by yfinance.
